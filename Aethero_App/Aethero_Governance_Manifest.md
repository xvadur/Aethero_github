# Aethero Governance Manifest

## Overview
This document serves as the official manifest for the Aethero Governance System, combining the capabilities of CrewAI and Superagent into a unified introspective operating system. Below is the modular structure and description of each component.

---

## Modular Structure

### agents/
- **Purpose**: Houses introspective ministers (agents) responsible for specific tasks.
- **Example**: `agent_minister_finance.json` defines goals, tools, hooks, and instruction loops for the finance minister.

### syntax/
- **Purpose**: Contains the constitution, laws, and master prompts.
- **Example**: `AETH_SYNTAX_DECREE_001X.json` defines the operational rules for agents.

### api/
- **Purpose**: Serverless endpoints compatible with Vercel.
- **Subdirectories**:
  - `api/crew/`
  - `api/super/`
  - `api/constitution/`

### memory/
- **Purpose**: References the memory subsystem, later integrated with ChromaDB/Weaviate.

---

## Agent Definitions
Each agent is defined in JSON/TS/PY files with the following structure:
- **Goals**: The objectives of the agent.
- **Tools**: APIs or utilities the agent can use.
- **Hooks**: Event-driven triggers.
- **Instruction Loops**: Repeated tasks or behaviors.
- **External API Integration**: Connections to external services like OpenAI or Superagent.

---

## Deployment
- **Platform**: Vercel (MVP) with future support for Unreal Engine (VR/AR).
- **Configuration**: `.vercel.json` for serverless functions.
- **Command**: `npx vercel --prod` for deployment.

---

## Metadata
- **Versioning**: All files follow the Aethero standard naming convention.
  - Example: `AETH_MINISTER_PROTOCOL_2025_000X.md`
- **Manifest**: This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system.

---

## Example Agent
### Ministry of Energy
- **Goals**: Monitor and optimize energy usage.
- **Tools**: Energy simulation APIs.
- **Hooks**: Triggered by high energy consumption events.
- **Instruction Loops**: Analyze, report, and suggest optimizations.

---

## Next Steps
1. Finalize the constitution in `syntax/`.
2. Implement agents in `agents/`.
3. Deploy the system and validate endpoints.
